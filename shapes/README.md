* Declaring structs to create your own data types which lets you bundle related data together and make the intent of your code clearer
* Declaring interfaces so you can define functions that can be used by different types (parametric polymorphism)
* Adding methods so you can add functionality to your data types and so you can implement interfaces
* Table driven tests to make your assertions clearer and your test suites easier to extend & maintain
