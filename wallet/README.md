### Pointers
* Go copies values when you pass them to functions/methods, so if you're writing a function that needs to mutate state you'll need it to take a pointer to the thing you want to change.
* The fact that Go takes a copy of values is useful a lot of the time but sometimes you won't want your system to make a copy of something, in which case you need to pass a reference. Examples include referencing very large data structures or things where only one instance is necessary (like database connection pools).

### nil
* Pointers can be nil
* When a function returns a pointer to something, you need to make sure you check if it's nil or you might raise a runtime exception - the compiler won't help you here.
Useful for when you want to describe a value that could be missing

### Errors
* Errors are the way to signify failure when calling a function/method.
* By listening to our tests we concluded that checking for a string in an error would result in a flaky test. So we refactored our implementation to use a meaningful value instead and this resulted in easier to test code and concluded this would be easier for users of our API too.
* This is not the end of the story with error handling, you can do more sophisticated things but this is just an intro. Later sections will cover more strategies.
* Donâ€™t just check errors, handle them gracefully: https://dave.cheney.net/2016/04/27/dont-just-check-errors-handle-them-gracefully
* Create new types from existing ones
* Useful for adding more domain specific meaning to values
* Can let you implement interfaces
